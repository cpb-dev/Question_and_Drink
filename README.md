# Question and Drink - The party game

This project was created as a proof of concept with a variety of different drinking game elements being mixed into one.
During lockdown, I noticed that online quizes were becoming increasingly popular among different groups of friends.
This gave me the idea to make a game that mixes the quiz styled question and answer with a group drinking game element.

The game is broken down into a set of different cards with different functions:

Quiz card - This presents the group with a question, only one person can answer. If incorrect the question gets opened back up to the group 3 times until someone answers correctly. Points are awarded accordingly.

Drinks card - These appear randomly at any point during the game. A player will get chosen to take a drink, the choice of who that is will also be randomised. For example, the game may pick the player with the most/least quiz/drinking points, or the most recent player to get a question wrong.

Party card - After answering 10 questions the group will be given a challenge to complete together. These are little games to break up the quiz and keep the players on their toes. Points can be given/taken depending on the card dealt.

Challenge card - THese choose a random player to compete a challenge alone. The player has the option to either complete the challenge or to forfiet, punishments and rewards will be dished out accordingly.

Other than drinks cards (that can appear at any point in the game) the games structure will consist of 50 questions, split up with party and challenge cards being dealt after every 10 questions. The order in which this plays out will be different for each game, in an attempt to provide a different experience on each game.

Thank you for checking out my project and for any contributions you may want to make!!
